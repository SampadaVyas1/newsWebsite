        <h1>History</h1>
        <div>
          Hindustan Times was founded in 1924 in Delhi by Sunder Singh
          Lyallpuri, founder-father of the Akali movement and the Shiromani
          Akali Dal.[9] S Mangal Singh Gill (Tesildar) and S. Chanchal Singh
          (Jandiala, Jalandhar) were made in charge of the newspaper. Madan
          Mohan Malaviya and Tara Singh were among the members of the Managing
          Committee. The Managing Chairman and Chief Patron was Master Sunder
          Singh Lyallpuri. According to Prem Shankar Jha, who wrote an official
          history of the newspaper in 1999, most of the early funding of the
          paper, therefore, came from Sikhs in Canada. When financial troubles
          started in the early years, the Akalis approached two interested
          potential buyers from the nationalist movement. These were Motilal
          Nehru and Madan Mohan Malaviya, and ultimately Malviya bought the
          Hindustan Times. In fact, Malviya had to take out a loan of Rs. 40,000
          with the help of Lala Lajpat Rai in order to finance the paper. In
          1928, Gandhi chose a new editor, K. M. Panikkar, for the paper. By
          that time, the paper was running into financial troubles again; G. D.
          Birla underwrote some expenses and ultimately assumed ownership.

        <div>
          The Delhi-based Hindustan Times is part of the KK Birla group and
          managed by Shobhana Bhartia, daughter of the industrialist Krishna
          Kumar Birla and granddaughter of Ghanshyam Das Birla.[citation needed]
          HT Media Limited is a subsidiary of The Hindustan Times Limited which
          is a subsidiary of Earthstone Holding (Two) Limited. The KK Birla
          group owns a 69 percent stake in HT Media, currently valued at â‚¹ 834
          crore. When Shobhana Bhartia joined Hindustan Times in 1986, she was
          the first female chief executive of a national newspaper. Shobhana has
          been nominated as a Rajya Sabha MP from Congress Party.[citation
          needed] Along with Hindustan Times, HT Media owns Desimartini, Fever
          104 FM, Hindustan Times Telugu[15] and the newspaper Mint.[

        <h1>Reception</h1>
        <div>
          In The Brand Trust Report 2012, Hindustan Times was ranked 291st among
          India's most trusted brands and subsequently, according to the Brand
          Trust Report 2013, Hindustan Times was ranked 434th among India's most
          trusted brands. In 2014 however, Hindustan Times was ranked 360th
          among India's most trusted brands according to the Brand Trust Report
          2014, a study conducted by Trust Research Advisory, a brand analytics
          company.[17] After the 2016 LoC strike in September, Shobhna Bhartia
          reportedly had started getting calls from the PM's office and from
          Amit Shah, and attention came to be focused on the Hate Tracker, a
          crowd-sourced database on the Hindustan Times website that recorded
          hate crimes in India which was launched under recently appointed
          editor Bobby Ghosh.[10] Ghosh left the newspaper abruptly afterwards
          and The Wire reported that he was asked to leave the newspaper after
          Shobhana Bhartia met Prime Minister Narendra Modi recently. Hindustan
          Times's general Counsel Dinesh Mittal rejected the report and said
          Bobby Ghosh left for personal reasons.[18] In 2017, the Frontline
          magazine[19] published a report which stated that Hindustan Times'
          editor Shishir Gupta was colluding with the government after releasing
          emails to Amit Shah. Hindustan Times rejected claims of collusion and
          said that the emails were a request for comment.[20] The Indian
          Express also published a report in 2017 stating that Hindustan Times
          Limited was linked to an offshore entity called Go4i.com, of which
          Bhartia and her son Priyavat were listed as directors.[10] Hindustan
          Times stated that this report contained "certain serious
          misrepresentations, grave inaccuracies and falsehoods" and added that
          "HT Ltd. did not, as a matter of fact, have any direct shareholding in
          Go4i.com"
